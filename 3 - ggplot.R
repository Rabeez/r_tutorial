# --------------- Bonus showcase (you're not supposed to understand the code here) --------------------

# Proper verification of the hypothesis by fitting separate linear models for each Color
# and comparing how the slope of fitted line changes for different Colors
# weighted regression is used because J color has MUCH fewer diamonds
