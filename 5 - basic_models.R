# FUNTIONAL INTERPRETATION OF MODELS
# These models assume a linear relationship of the form
# y = m*x + c        where m is the slope and c is the y-intercept and x is independent variable, y is dependent variable
# x is also called the feature/regressor and y is also called the target/response
# The model assumes a directly proportional relationship with m being the proportionality constant and c being the offset

# We can have multiple variables involved in the regression (multiple linear regression)
# In such a model the assumption is that the target is proportional to all variables (with different amount) with a single intercept

# There appears to be a linear trend between log(population) and life expectancy

# ----- generalized linear models -----
# Mathematical generalization of regression concept
# STATISTICAL INTERPRETATION OF MODELS
# The models assume that the target Y is a random variable obeying some distribution (usually gaussian)
# This RV is determined by Y = h + noise where h is the unobservable 'true' signal and we only see Y 
# which has noise (measurement, inherent, systemic, etc) added to it. 
# For the gaussian model we model Y ~ N(mX+c, sigma) where m is the slope and c is the y-intercept, X is independent random variable and sigma is the noise component
# The expression mu = mX+c is a 'link function' because we are 'linking' a parameter of the target distribution as a function of the regressor RV

# ALL statistical tests are specific forms of this framework
# GLM = formula + family + link-function

# gaussian family (default link = linear) is equivalent to plain-old linear regression
